## 🤖 How AI Was Used in Development

This project was built using **AI-assisted development** (Vibe Coding) to accelerate the development process:

1. **Code Generation**: Used AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to generate boilerplate code and UI components
2. **API Integration**: AI helped structure the OpenAI API calls and JSON parsing logic
3. **Error Debugging**: Quick troubleshooting of import paths and dependency issues
4. **UI/UX Design**: AI suggestions for color schemes, layouts, and user flow
5. **Documentation**: AI-assisted README and code comments generation

### Key Prompts Used:
- "Create a Flutter recipe model with all necessary fields"
- "Generate a service class for OpenAI API integration with error handling"
- "Build a Material 3 UI for ingredient input with chips"
- "Fix import path errors in Flutter project structure"

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Add Ingredients**: Enter ingredients you have (e.g., "chicken, tomatoes, onions")
2. **Set Preferences**: Optionally choose dietary restrictions and cuisine type
3. **Generate Recipe**: Tap "Generate Recipe with AI" and wait for your personalized recipe
4. **View Details**: See ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and nutritional info
5. **Save Favorites**: Bookmark recipes you love for later

## 🔑 API Configuration

The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. To use your own API key:

1. Sign up at https://platform.openai.com
2. Generate an API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file (never commit this file!)
4. The app will automatically load it on startup

**Note**: API calls cost money. Monitor your usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage

## 🧪 Testing

Run the app in debug mode to test features:

```bash
flutter run --debug
```

For production build:

```bash
flutter build apk --release  # Android
flutter build ios --release  # iOS
```
